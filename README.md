### **Please note that this is for Visual Studio, NOT VSCode!**

Credit to [this repository](https://github.com/ostef/vscode-jai) because I simply copy-pasted the ``jai.tmLanguage`` file and configured a Visual Studio project to build a ``.vsix`` that adds syntax highlighting. The syntax highlighting is very basic, please do not expect some crazy fancy stuff. I made this for myself to just get the job done so it's not plain white text because I could not find an existing one. I'm sure someone will come along and make a much better and more sophisticated one at some point, but this gets the job done for now until then :D

Compatible With:
- Visual Studio 2022
- Visual Studio 2019
